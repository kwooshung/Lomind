- `Lomind` is a tool library deeply inspired by `Lodash`, yet it's not intended to be a direct replacement for `Lodash`. The reason lies in `Lodash`'s already proven excellence in performance and reliability. Instead, `Lomind` aims to assimilate the best practices from numerous outstanding open-source libraries while expanding its capabilities. It introduces a greater array of modular and high-performance utilities, particularly tailored for enhanced programming experiences in `JavaScript`, `React Hooks`, and `Vue Hooks`.
- `Lomind` is an exquisitely crafted open-source library, drawing inspiration from the ancient wisdom encapsulated in the saying, **“路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索”** Just as this poetic line portrays, `Lomind` embodies the spirit of unwavering determination, the pursuit of truth, and relentless exploration in the vast journey of the programming world, advancing steadily forward with each step.
- `Lomind`, drawing on the strengths of numerous exceptional open-source libraries, expands their powerful functionalities. It brings to the forefront an array of modular and high-performance utilities, meticulously crafted and tailored for `JavaScript`, `React Hooks`, and `Vue Hooks`. This library is a testament to the advancement in programming tools, specifically engineered to enhance the development experience in these popular frameworks.
- `Lomind` is developed in `TypeScript` and offers comprehensive type definition files, making it readily usable in `TypeScript` projects as well as in `JavaScript` environments. This library seamlessly integrates the robustness of `TypeScripts` type system, thereby ensuring greater reliability and developer efficiency across various project types.
- `Lomind` is built using `Vite`, offering various modularized build files compatible with different environments such as `ESM`, `CommonJS`, and `UMD`. This versatility ensures that `Lomind` can be effortlessly integrated and utilized across a diverse range of development scenarios, catering to the specific needs of each module system.
- `Lomind` is dedicated to a more streamlined and flat function design, aiming to minimize dependencies between functions. With no core functions or features, developers have the freedom to selectively incorporate only the functions they need, alleviating concerns about introducing excessive dependencies. This approach ensures a lightweight, flexible, and efficient integration tailored to specific project requirements.

## 🍃 Origin of the Name

- Lo = Lodash, as `Lomind` references function designs from numerous outstanding open-source libraries like Lodash, reducing the learning curve for developers.
- mind = brain/thought/wisdom/mind, because `Lomind` is designed to lead developers steadily forward in the vast journey of coding, encouraging continuous exploration. Moreover, every piece of `Lomind` code has been analyzed and optimized with the power of AI to enhance performance and readability.
- Lo + mind = `Lomind`; also, its pronunciation is reminiscent of "the long road", hence the name `Lomind`. It resonates perfectly with the verse **“路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索”** from **"Li Sao"**, a poem by **Qu Yuan**, an esteemed figure from the Warring States period in China. The name embodies the undying spirit of perseverance, truth-seeking, and continuous exploration.

## 💡 Why Develop It?

In the development process of `React` and `Vue`, deciding whether to implement a function as a `hook` or a regular function often poses a dilemma. After all, each implementation has its advantages in different scenarios. `Lomind` aims to eliminate this hesitation by offering a flexible solution that allows developers to choose freely based on their specific needs. Whether you want to use hooks for better state management and handling side effects, or prefer the simplicity and intuitiveness of traditional functions, `Lomind` meets your requirements. In short, `Lomind` offers true freedom of development, making choices no longer a challenge!
